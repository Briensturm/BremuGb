BremuGb is a cycle-accurate Gameboy emulator which is developed in C# and runs on .net core.
The main goals of the project are high accuracy and more importantly, a human readable codebase, which many existing Gameboy emulators are lacking.

Currently supported features:
*Full speed Gameboy emulation
*4 channel 41KHz audio
*MBC 1-5 with battery saves
*Somewhat accurate rendering pipeline (Prehistorik Man)

Currently unsupported:
*CGB (Gameboy Color) emulation
*Emulation of more obscure MBCs/Hardware
